# TottalyKickAssTube

## Overview

**TotallyKickAssTube** is a totally kick ass YouTube client powered by YT-DLP (https://github.com/yausername/youtubedl-android. and Jackson.
Made to look roughly like a Material app (none of that Material bs, which to be fair I do find kind of cool maybe I'll make a fork with that design idk).

## Contributing

I welcome contributions, if you really want to. Hereâ€™s how you can help:
- Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
- Open a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.

I'd say ensure that your code follows the existing style, but I really have no style it is all crap,
just make sure it works and isn't malware and I'll probably merge. I don't care if Android Studio whines 
about the quality, this app is already programmed like crap anyways (probably ChatGPT could do better lol).

Don't care if you used ChatGPT or something, as long as it's only for programming/basic UX,
and you know it works.

DO NOT USE AI ICONS OR ANYTHING AT ALL FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
